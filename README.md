# Communication-Systems-Simulation-Experiments
This repository contains two communication systems simulation experiments. Each experiment focuses on different aspects of communication systems, modulation schemes, and error analysis.

* exp1: QPSK Communication System in Rayleigh Fading Channel
  * Explore the representation of the Rayleigh fading channel.
  * Build a QPSK communication simulation system using MATLAB.
  * Analyze the bit error rate (BER) of the system in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in a Rayleigh fading channel.
  * Enhance the system by implementing channel coding and decoding, then reanalyze the BER using MATLAB.
 
* exp2: MIMO-OFDM System and BER Curve
  * Design a MIMO-OFDM (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) simulation system.
  * Define relevant parameters for the simulation.
  * Implement QPSK modulation, and simulate the system.
  * Generate and plot the bit error rate (BER) curve for the MIMO-OFDM system.
 
Please use MATLAB to run with the codes. Happy simulating!
